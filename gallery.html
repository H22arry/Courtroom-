			<p>RULES OF COURT</p>
<p>The Rules of Court are made in accordance with the provisions of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act and regulate and prescribe the procedure and practice to be followed, mainly in civil proceedings in the High Court and the Court of Appeal.

The Rules of Court do not apply to the procedure and practice of family proceedings (as set out in the Family Justice Act), which are prescribed in the Family Justice Rules instead.
